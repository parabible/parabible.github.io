Some time ago I wrote [somewhere else](https://jcuenod.github.io/bibletech/2018/03/25/finding-hebrew-by-greek/) about how to find a Hebrew word only when the LXX translates it with a particular Greek word. That post was inspired by a post over at the real [**bibletech**](https://bibleandtech.blogspot.com/) ([here](https://bibleandtech.blogspot.com/2018/03/finding-hebrew-words-translated-by.html)) where Mark Hoffman has a helpful writeup on how to do it on Accordance, Logos and Bibleworks but I've got to say, [Parabible](https://parabible.com/) just makes it look a lot easier. I am duplicating that post here because it's a useful technique.

Before we begin, let's remember that there's no such thing as "The Septuagint" - with that in mind, Parabible's LXX data is not fantastic but it is free. Apparently, I may be using the same alignment data that Bibleworks uses though to get LXX lexemes on Hebrew words - so maybe it's not that bad... (well, it's still bad but it's the boat we're all stuck in).

**Step One:** In Parabible, Hebrew words have a bunch of associated morphological data. One of those data points is "Parallel Lexeme". If you click on a word and don't see that field, make sure it's enabled in the `Morphology Settings` in the `Options` menu. So if you're looking for words that the LXX translates with `ἱλάσκομαι`, for example. You might head over to 2 Kings 5:18 and click on `יִסְלַח`. That'll give you something like:

**Step Two:** Click on the `Root` field and the `Parallel Lexeme` field to highlight both of them. Having highlighted both of them, click `Add Search Term` (the big blue button). I've already done that in the picture above.

**Step Three:** Hit `Search` and enjoy the results:
