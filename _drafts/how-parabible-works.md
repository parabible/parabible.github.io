Initially my biggest constraint was speed of search. I really wanted the most rapid response imaginable. Of course the more results, the slower the response time but right now (this is the model that is in use) I am getting responses of xxx ms in queries that find xxx results (though, only 500 are returned).

# How does it work?



# What are the problems?

## 1. RAM is an actual constraint

## 2. Obscurity of what's going on

## 3. Difficulty of adding new data

# What's Next?
